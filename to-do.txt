More Important:
Board, given a Tile Array List, must return a List<Move> of all possible moves.
TileBag needs a print function.
Add CLI (UserInput) so player can input their own moves.
Add Minimax ADT and Node class so CPU can find best moves.
    MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER MONTE CARLO SIMULATION.
Implement GameManager to iterate through all of the players and get settings at the beginning.
Create GUI in Display class.
Add a secondary GUI so the player can configure settings at the beginning.

Less Important:
Create a Tile List container class(?)
Make TileBag implement Iterable
